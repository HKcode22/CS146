- since I saw there was a solution already on canvas I decided to do some research to learn
  other ways to solve this problem
- using iterative way to compare characters from both ends, converting all characters to lowercase
- using pointers. if characters dont maatch any point the string is not palindorme, if pointers meet or cross eachother without mismatches the string is palindorome
- reverse preprocessed string, comparing string, if identical then string is palindrome
