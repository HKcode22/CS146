- for java I went for the approach of using dfs which uses stack
- I used while loop 
- I saved saved the coordinates of the images into the stack, sr and sc
- I then popped them out of the stack, saved it into a int of arrays, row and col
- I thought of how I can use the if statment to check if the current coordinates of images dont equal 
the originalcolor int then go to the next iteration
- only change the color if the coordinates that are being traversed are equal originalcolor int
- using stack push, pushing new coordinates, traversing, and then poping those new coordinates and 
using them for images for the if statment to check if it equals to the originalcolor
- if it does then change the color to the new color, if it doesent then go to the next iteration, 
thus it doesent fill the new color, which makes the neibhors change color or int
- And I only traversed to the left right up and down of the current coordinations in each iterations
- In python I used bfs queue and similar approach
