-built a graph using list of list of integer, saved vertex of each pipes, representing houses
-each pipe represent an edge between two house with weight by the cost of the pipe
-adding virtual node representing water source, connecting virtual node to all houses that have edges 
-using prims algorithm, selecting cheapest edege, using mincost updating it, using visted to check which vertex
have been visted 
- calculating mincost sum up the costs of the selected edges to get the total minimum total cost
- using queue as well storing edges based on their weights, keeping track of visited
