-inorder to tackle this problem I first sort the arrays
- then interate through it using 2 pointers, left and right
- then checking if the sum equals zero if it does then its a triplet and I put it in the trip list
- Updated pointers, moving the left pointer to right and the right pointer to the left, if sum is less than zero
then we increament left and if sum is greater than zero then we decrement the right pointer
