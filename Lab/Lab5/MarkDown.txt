- The high level approaches I took is that I thought of traversing through the tree to check if the 
left subtree values are less than the root and if the values in the right subtree are greater than the root.

- I used if statements to check this validations, I made the upper and lower as well to use the value of the root 
to compare it with left and right subtree values. And I used the recursion method as well.
