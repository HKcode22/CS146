-reading the problem and looking at the slides this problem was pretty difficult to solve because it had 
alot of thinking to do, this problem is about determining the possibility to finish all courses
- its uses graphs and we need to use topological sort, I used Khans algorithm, queue
- I stored the prereq elemnts in graph connecting the second element to the first like a directed line
  from second node to the first 
- we represent the course of prereq as a DAG directed acyclic graph, ecah course is a node
  and each prereq had a edge, we calcualte indegree of each course to find its prereq, performing
- topological sorting using khans algorithm, only adding nodes that have 0 indegree to the queue keeping
  track of courses with indegree 0, stored indegree in a int array
